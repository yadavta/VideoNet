Often used as a linking step between other movements. Look for the smooth, controlled quality and the close positioning of the feet during the turn.", "backspin": "A power move where the dancer spins continuously on their upper back with their legs tucked or in various positions. The spinning momentum is generated by initially swinging the legs. Look for the dancer rotating on their upper back with their legs helping to control the spin speed.", "air-frying": "A cooking method that circulates hot air rapidly around food placed in a perforated basket or tray, creating a crispy exterior similar to deep-frying but using little to no oil. Air fryers are essentially compact convection ovens that use powerful fans to blow hot air around food from all sides, which creates the browning and crisping effect typically associated with deep-frying. Look for food that has a crispy, golden exterior while remaining moist inside.", "timber hitch": "A knot used to attach a rope to a log or pole, especially for dragging or lifting. Look for the wraps around the standing part that tighten their grip as tension is applied.

Visually impressive as the yo-yo tilts and flips upside down slowly, distinctly unlike simpler static mounts.", "dividing perennials": "Digging up an entire perennial plant clump (which is... a non-woody plant living multiple years) and physically splitting the root ball and crown into smaller sections, each with roots and shoots, to propagate (create new) plants. Look for: a person lifting a whole plant clump and cutting or pulling the root mass apart into pieces.", "the box": "A pattern that combines vertical (columns-like) throws with horizontal throws to create a box shape in the air. The balls appear to trace several sides of a box with their trajectories. Look for the square or rectangular pattern formed by the balls' paths.", "paradiddle": "A step borrowed from drum rudiments, consisting of a scuffle followed by a step-heel on the same foot. The dancer performs a scuff-brush combination followed by stepping on the ball of the foot and dropping the heel. Look for the four distinct sounds in a flowing sequence. This differs from paddle and roll only in terminology, as they're essentially the same step.", "underbar": "A movement where the practitioner passes feet-first through a gap under an obstacle, using their hands to guide and control the motion. Look for the swing-through motion under an object.", "zeppelin bend": "A reliable bend knot for joining two ropes that remains secure under load but is easily untied even after being heavily loaded.

Look for the distinct small, puffy \"bean\" shapes that create a textured surface.", "pendulum shading": "Creating smooth gradients by swinging the tattoo machine's needle grouping (often a magnum shader, which is... needles arranged in flat rows) in a pendulum-like arc across the skin. The needle goes deeper or slower in the middle of the swing and lifts or moves faster at the ends, depositing less ink at the edges for a soft fade. Look for: the artist using a smooth, arcing hand motion, like a pendulum swinging back and forth, to apply shading that fades softly at the edges of each stroke.", "waltz clog": "A step derived from clog dancing set to waltz (3/4) timing. The dancer performs a flap followed by two steps in waltz timing. Look for the distinctive one-TWO-THREE rhythm pattern. This differs from other flap combinations by its specific waltz rhythm and timing structure.", "cabriole": "A jumping step where the dancer springs into the air from one leg, extends the other leg, and then the supporting leg beats against it before landing. The name comes from the French word for \"caper\" or goat-like jump. Look for the distinctive beating of the extended leg by the supporting leg at the height of the jump.", "clove hitch": "A versatile knot made of two successive single hitches tied around an object. It is effective for securing a middle section of rope to an object it crosses, such as a post or pole. Look for the crossed \"X\" pattern on one side with parallel lines on the opposite side. While quick to tie and adjust, it's not completely secure on its own and may slip under changing loads.", "areflexia": "The complete loss or absence of normal reflexes. Typically, when a medical professional taps certain tendons (for example, below the knee), the body automatically responds with muscle twitch or movement. A person with areflexia demonstrates no muscle response or movement upon performing reflex tests. Areflexia usually indicates damage or disease affecting nerve pathways to the muscle (peripheral nerves or lower motor neurons) and can occur in disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, peripheral nerve damage, or diabetic nerve issues.", "helicopter shot": "An unorthodox batting shot where the batsman uses powerful wrists to whip the bat through the line and follow through with a circular motion above the head. Look for the distinctive full-circle bat rotation resembling helicopter blades.", "sheaf stitch": "A decorative stitch that resembles a bundle of wheat or a sheaf, created by a group of straight stitches gathered together in the middle with a binding stitch.

Each backaround is connected by a pass (a 0.5 rotation transfer between finger slots). Look for the pen spinning completely around each finger in sequence from index to pinky, with small linking movements between each rotation. This differs from a regular finger pass because each finger gets a complete around rotation rather than just a 0.5 pass transfer.", "flipper": "A delivery bowled by a leg-spinner that is released with backspin, causing the ball to skid on faster and lower than expected after pitching. Look for the ball staying low after bouncing and maintaining speed rather than slowing down.", "standing single crochet": "A technique that allows you to start a new row or round with a single crochet stitch without using beginning chains. You begin with a slip knot on your hook, insert your hook into the desired stitch, and complete a single crochet as normal. This creates a cleaner start than the traditional slip stitch, chain-1 beginning, especially for color changes. The standing single crochet eliminates the visible join at the beginning of rows and blends perfectly with other single crochet stitches in your project.", "cushing suture": "An inverting suture technique (which is one that turns tissue edges inward) where the needle takes bites parallel to the wound edge through outer layers without fully penetrating the inside space (lumen), often used on hollow organs.

If light passes through without the dough breaking, gluten has developed adequately. Look for the thin, see-through \"windowpane\" of stretched dough.", "back loop only (blo)": "A crochet technique where you insert your hook through only the back loop of a stitch rather than both loops. When looking at the top of a stitch, you'll see a \"V\" shape - the back loop is the part of the V furthest from you. BLO creates a horizontal ridge on the front of your work and adds texture and stretch to your project. This technique is often used for creating ribbing, defining edges, or adding decorative elements to crochet projects.", "coffee grinder": "A breakdancing-inspired movement where the practitioner places one hand on the ground and rotates their body around it in a circular motion. Look for the one-handed pivot with the body sweeping around in a circle.", "carving": "A turning technique where the skater makes wide, sweeping turns using the edges of the board (the sides of the skateboard), similar to a snowboarder.
