Biellmann Spin: A spin where the skater grabs their free blade and pulls the heel of their boot behind and above the level of the head, creating a split position with the head and back arched upward. Look for the distinctive "teardrop" shape formed by the skater's body.
Camel Spin: A spin where the skater spins on one foot with the free leg extended straight behind the body, parallel to the ice at hip level, creating an arabesque-like position. The body should form a horizontal line.
Combination Spin: A spin where the skater changes feet and/or positions while maintaining speed and a continuous spin. Look for multiple distinct positions connected within one continuous spinning motion.
Crossovers: A skating move where one foot crosses over the other as a way of gaining speed and turning corners. Look for one foot literally crossing over or in front of the other foot.
Death Spiral: A pairs element where the man rotates in a pivot position while holding one hand of his partner, who is rotating in a horizontal position around him with her body low and parallel to the ice.
Layback Spin: A spin where the skater spins while leaning backward with an arched back, often with one leg extended backward. Look for the distinctive arched upper body position with the head tilted back.
Scratch Spin: An upright spin where the skater extends their free leg in front of them with their knee bent. As the skater brings their free leg down and crosses over the ankle of the spinning leg while drawing the arms in, the spin accelerates.
Sit Spin: A spin where the skater spins in a "sitting" position, with the upper part of the skating leg at least parallel to the ice. Look for the thigh of the skating leg to be parallel to the ice.
Three-Turn: A one-foot turn where the skater changes edge and direction, resulting with a "3" being traced on the ice. Look for the skater to remain on the same foot throughout the turn.
Bracket Turn: A one-foot turn with a change of edge that results in a "}" shape traced on the ice. Look for the skater turning in the opposite direction of the curve they are skating on.
Mohawk: A two-foot turn where the skater changes feet (left to right or right to left) and direction (front to back or back to front), but maintains the same edge (outside to outside or inside to inside).
Rocker: A one-foot turn where the skater changes from back to front or front to back, maintaining the same edge (outside to outside or inside to inside). The blade turns in the direction of the exit curve.
Choctaw: A two-foot turn involving both a change of foot and a change of edge and lobe. Look for the skater changing from one foot to the other and simultaneously changing edge quality (inside to outside or outside to inside).
Hydroblade: An edge move where a skater glides on a deep edge with the body stretched in a very low position, almost touching the ice. Commonly performed on a backward inside edge with both hands on the ice for balance.
Spiral: A position where a skater keeps one foot on the ice and extends the free leg above hip level. Look for the extended free leg to be at hip height or higher.
Stroking: The basic skating action of pushing from one foot to the other to generate momentum across the ice. Look for alternating pushes with each foot.
Twizzle: A traveling turn where the skater performs a one-foot turn with one or more rotations which is quickly executed. Look for a continuous turning motion while traveling across the ice, not staying in one spot.
Twist Lift: A pairs move where the male partner lifts the female over his head and tosses her in the air. While airborne, the female partner twists. The man then catches his partner and places her back on the ice.
Half-Flip Jump: A jump where skaters rotate from backwards to forwards. Look for only a half rotation, with the skater starting backwards and landing forwards.
Mazurka Jump: A small, one-foot hop jump where the skater takes off from one foot and lands on the other. Not one of the six main rotational jumps.
Split Jump: A jump where the skater creates a straddle position, forming a V with their legs. Look for the legs to separate into a full split position in the air.
Waltz Jump: A simple jump with half a rotation that begins with a forward outside edge takeoff. Look for the skater facing forward at takeoff and backward at landing, completing only half a rotation.
Double Salchow: A salchow jump with two rotations in the air. Look for the back inside edge takeoff without toe pick assistance.
Double Toe Loop: A toe loop jump with two rotations in the air. Look for the back outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Double Flip: A flip jump with two rotations in the air. Look for the inside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Double Loop: A loop jump with two rotations in the air. Look for the back outside edge takeoff without toe pick assistance.
Double Lutz: A lutz jump with two rotations in the air. Look for the deep outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Double Axel: An axel jump with two and a half rotations in the air. Look for the forward takeoff characteristic of all axel jumps.
Triple Toe Loop: A toe loop jump with three rotations in the air. Look for the back outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Triple Salchow: A salchow jump with three rotations in the air. Look for the back inside edge takeoff without toe pick assistance.
Triple Flip: A flip jump with three rotations in the air. Look for the inside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Triple Lutz: A lutz jump with three rotations in the air. Look for the deep outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Triple Axel: An axel jump with three and a half rotations in the air. Look for the forward takeoff characteristic of all axel jumps.
Quad Toe Loop: A toe loop jump with four rotations in the air. Look for the back outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Quad Salchow: A salchow jump with four rotations in the air. Look for the back inside edge takeoff without toe pick assistance.
Quad Loop: A loop jump with four rotations in the air. Look for the back outside edge takeoff without toe pick assistance.
Quad Flip: A flip jump with four rotations in the air. Look for the inside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Quad Lutz: A lutz jump with four rotations in the air. Look for the deep outside edge takeoff with toe pick assistance.
Quad Axel: An axel jump with four and a half rotations in the air. Look for the forward takeoff characteristic of all axel jumps, followed by 4.5 rotations before landing.
Cantilever: A move where the skater travels along a deep edge with knees bent, bending their back backwards parallel to the ice. Look for the skater's upper body leaning back toward the ice surface while gliding.
