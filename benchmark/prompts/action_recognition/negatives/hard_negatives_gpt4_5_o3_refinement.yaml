# Universal prompt for creating genuinely challenging "hard negative" options
system_prompt: |
  You are creating challenging "hard negative" options for multimodal action classification datasets across various domains (sports, arts, crafts, cooking, etc.).

  Each action requires 3 hard negative options that are genuinely difficult for a machine learning model to distinguish from the positive action.

  A truly "hard" negative:
  - Shares visual/motion similarities with the positive action that would be difficult to distinguish in brief clips
  - Is fundamentally different in purpose or technique despite visual similarities
  - Cannot reasonably co-occur with the positive action in the same short video
  - Avoids obvious selection patterns that would make classification too easy

  Note:
    Negatives should only come from the action list provided (not definitions or other sources)
      - Check that EXACT positive and negative action names are used in the actions list when generating csv.

      Below is my list of "{ACTION}" actions, along with their definitions:

      {ACTION_DEFINITION}

      Your task is to create genuinely challenging "hard negative" options for each action that would confuse a computer vision model. Format your output as a clean CSV:

      action,negative_1,negative_2,negative_3
      (action_1),(hard negative_1),(hard negative_2),(hard negative_3)
      ...

      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRULY HARD NEGATIVES:

      1. MAXIMIZE VISUAL CONFUSION WITHOUT OBVIOUS PATTERNS:
         - Select actions that share visual features, body positions, or motion qualities with the positive action
         - Avoid predictable selection patterns (e.g., don't always choose the "next level up/down" or "same family" actions)
         - Mix selection criteria unpredictably to prevent the model from learning simple heuristics
         
      2. STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY:
         - Include some negatives that differ in subtle ways (small variations in technique/position)
         - Include some negatives that differ in more significant ways but still maintain visual similarity
         - Vary the type of similarity (sometimes motion-based, sometimes position-based, sometimes tool/environment-based)
         
      3. AVOID FUNCTIONALLY RELATED ACTIONS FOR NEGATIVES:
         - Never select actions that typically occur together with the positive action
         - Avoid actions that are commonly performed in sequence or as part of the same technique
         - Don't pair actions that would naturally appear in the same short video clip
         - Don't pair action categories that are too similar or the same as the positive action

      4. REASONABLE DISTRIBUTION:
         - Each action should appear as a negative approximately 2-5 times across the dataset
         - Avoid extreme over-representation or under-representation
         - The overall pattern of selections should appear random and unpredictable

      Please provide your hard negative choices for these actions in the same order as provided:

      {ACTION_LIST}

      Negatives should only EXACTLY come from the action list provided (not definitions or made-up sources)
      - Check that EXACT positive and negative action names are used in the actions list when generating csv.

      Please provide your analysis of negative selections for their effectiveness as genuinely "hard" negatives:

      First, check for selection patterns that could make classification too easy:
      * Are there predictable patterns in how negatives were selected?
      * Is there too much consistency in how negatives relate to positives?
      * Would these patterns potentially provide shortcuts for a classification model?

      Second, examine the visual confusion potential:
      * How visually similar are the negatives to their positive actions?
      * Is there sufficient variety in the types of visual similarity?
      * Are the differences appropriately subtle to create genuine challenges?

      Third, check for functional relationships:
      * Are there any positive-negative pairs that typically occur together?
      * Are there pairs that represent sequential or component actions?
      * Would any pairs likely appear together in a short video clip?

      Finally, review the overall distribution:
      * Is any action severely over-represented or under-represented as a negative?
      * Does the selection appear sufficiently unpredictable and varied?
      * Are there imbalances that should be addressed?

      For any issues identified, suggest specific improvements to create more genuinely challenging hard negatives.
      Provide a summary of the analysis and suggestions for improvement.

      Based on the analysis, provide a revised CSV with improved hard negatives. Focus on fixing:

      1. The most problematic selection patterns identified
      2. Any actions with co-occurring negatives
      3. Distribution imbalances

      Briefly explain the changes made to each action's negatives, ensuring that the new selections are genuinely challenging and visually confusing.
      Then, provide the revised CSV with fixed negative selections, without detailed explanations for each change.

      Based on the comprehensive analysis and specific suggestions, synthesize a final CSV with truly challenging hard negatives for each action.

      Incorporate all the suggested improvements while ensuring:
      1. The final list follows the exact same order as the original action list
      2. Each action has 3 negatives that create genuine visual confusion
      3. The selection patterns remain unpredictable and varied
      4. No functionally related actions are paired
      5. The distribution is reasonably balanced (each action appears 2-5 times as a negative)

      Provide the final clean CSV with optimized hard negatives:
